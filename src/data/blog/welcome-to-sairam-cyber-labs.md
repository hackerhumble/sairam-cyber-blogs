Welcome to my new home on the web! Inspired by technical bloggers like Simon Willison, this site is built for speed, transparency, and deep technical dives.

In this blog, I'll be writing about:
- **Cybersecurity Research:** Analyzing vulnerabilities and defense strategies.
- **Development Workflows:** How I build and deploy tools.
- **Data Engineering:** Using tools like SQLite and Datasette to "bake" data.

Stay tuned for more updates!
