Welcome to **Sairam Cyber Labs**. 

This is where I document my technical journey across cybersecurity, software development, and data engineering. My philosophy is inspired by the "baked data" approach—creating fast, resilient, and highly searchable technical content.

## What I do

- **Cybersecurity:** Vulnerability research, CTFs, and defensive strategies.
- **Development:** Building tools with Python, TypeScript, and Go.
- **Data:** Leveraging SQLite and Datasette for public interest data projects.
